\section{Contributions}
Implementing a state estimator for a formula student race car estimating $v_x$, $v_y$, tyre-ground friction coefficient as well as bank and inclination angle of the ground. An improved front end for slam using ideas from probabilistic data association, effectively removing false positives without throwing away uncertain detections before it is needed.
