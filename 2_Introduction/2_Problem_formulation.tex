\section{Problem formulation}
Estimate local changes in the states using sensor data; use this and local detections of cones to build a map of the race tracks delimiters and place the vehicle in this map. The overall error in the estimated map and pose must be small enough for the car to confidently avoid the delimiters. The run time of the algorithm must be small enough for the car to drive at the teams goal mean velocity of $10 m/s$.
